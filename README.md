The ultimate shitposting bot on discord, with a variety of commands for various purposes, including moderation (we have a thanos command that kicks half of a server's members).  
  
Slav Bot is mainly centered around its _image editing commands_ that allow you to make whatever meme you wish right from discord using either direct editing commands or templates. Slav Bot also gives access to various commands that provide you with images.  
  
Slav Bot is also known for its _World War (conquer all countries), Slave Trading (buy other users as slaves) and Warfare (PvP/Gain XP by killing others) Games_, where you collect tokens to compete with others in various ways.  
  
Slav Bot also has its own Trading Card Game called _Calamity Cards, a trading card game where you can purchase various Heroes and Villains from comic books, movies, TV shows and more._ Buy character packs to collect all of the unique characters. Try your best to get as many platinum characters as you can to increase your rank and sell your unwanted cards to earn tokens.  
  
Slav Bot also has _unexpected responses to certain words or messages_, the list can be found on the documentation page on our site. You can even add _custom responses and counters_ from our site. (This feature can be turned on/off using the respond command on Slav Bot).  
  
Our bot has a huge command list, but each is unique in its own way. Slav Bot is the perfect bot to have if you just want to have some fun and shitpost, or just play some games. There is something for everyone.
